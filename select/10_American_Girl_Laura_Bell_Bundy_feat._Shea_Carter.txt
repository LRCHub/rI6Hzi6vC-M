I wish it could be simple
Wish I could be happy with what I got
I could live the dream for just two hours
Sailing on a rented yacht
Trust fund wanna-be, got these new shoes
Over-bored with an overdraft fee
I wish I was happy, but I'm not

Why's it so hard being an American girl
Why's it so hard living in a first-problem world
When the prettiest things are now holding me back
And I can't get away from this massive attack
Why's it so hard being an American girl

Too young for the bar
So I went to the bank
Got a loan for college
Where all I did was drank
Workin' so hard to repay sallie mae
Gonna have to freeze my eggs if I want kids someday

If you build it they will come
I don't think that works for everyone
Chevrolet promises windblown hair
Now I'm stuck in traffic going nowhere

Why's it so hard being an American girl
Why's it so hard living in a first-problem world
When the American promise is the land of the free
But I'm waiting for the bill for the air that I breath
Why's it so hard being an American girl

Every heart beats true
Every heart beats true
Every heart beats true
Every heart beats true
For the red white & blue
Tell me girls, what are we gonna do

Girl power is more than a spice, it's a meal
Don't let them feed you
You can't trust what they have
Put the pill under your tongue
When they turn their backs
So, put your highest heels on
Because we have to aim HIGH
Why is it so hard being an American girl
